        <p>
            My goals are to explore my capibilities and limit test myself. I seek to become the best version of myself,
            hence why
            I am willing to do anything to achieve to my dreams. I am seeking discomfort and new experiences to impact

        <h4> <u>Summary</u> </h4>
        <p>
            I am currently a student at Concordia University doing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am in my
            first year and
            am expecting to learn a lot in the excited coming years. I was fortunately born in safe country, Canada, and
            grew up playing video games.
            Fascinated by computers, I rapidly started enjoying the complex functionality of computers hardware and
            software. This led me to pursue computer science
            as my major.
